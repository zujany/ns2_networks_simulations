# ns2_networks_simulations

Simulation of to nodes connected by a duplex link, with two sources sending data: an ON/OFF source and a CBR source, with the main goal of study the package latency of the ON/OFF source, while varying the percentage of the bandwith taken by the CBR source and the burstiness of the ON/OFF source.
